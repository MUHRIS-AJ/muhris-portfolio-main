# Profile Image Setup

## Important: Add Your Profile Image

To complete the Zhuxin-style portfolio setup, you need to add your profile image to the `public` folder.

### Steps:

1. **Save your profile image** (the casual outfit version works best for the hero section)
2. **Name it exactly**: `profile-main.jpg`
3. **Place it in**: `public/profile-main.jpg`

### Image Requirements:

- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Recommended size**: 800x800px or larger (square aspect ratio works best)
- **File name**: `profile-main.jpg` (or update the path in `HeroSection.jsx` if you use a different name)

### Alternative Images (Optional):

You can also add:
- `profile-professional.jpg` - For professional sections
- `profile-closeup.jpg` - For close-up portrait sections

### Current Status:

The portfolio is configured to use `/profile-main.jpg`. If the image is not found, it will display your initials as a fallback.

### Where the Image is Used:

- **Hero Section**: Main landing area with mystical glow effects
- The image will have:
  - Purple/pink glow border
  - Floating animation
  - Glowing particles around it
  - Mystical shadow effects
